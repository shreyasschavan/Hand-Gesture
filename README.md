Hand gesture recognition is one of the growing fields of research today which provides a natural way of human machine interaction.
The goal was to provide a Natural way for user to interact with multimedia Content without the need for traditional input devices like a keyboard or mouse.
It means instead of pressing buttion you could just wave your hand to perform multimedia operation
The project aimed to recognize hand gestures & translate them into actions that Control multimedia media playback & Other Operations.

MODULES:
Gesture Image: The Gesture shot feature allows you to take a picture with a hand gesture using the front camera.
 
Gesture Detection: Recognition of Hand Gestures. When the fingers are detected and recognized, the hand gesture can be recognized using a simple rule classifier. In the rule classifier, the hand gesture is predicted according to the number and content of fingers detected.

Preprocessing: Preprocessing should be done on images initially before we extract features from data of Hand Gestures. It is to be done to remove noise, unwanted errors and to make data efficient so, that it can be used for further image processing.

Feature Extraction: Feature Extraction uses an object-based approach to classify imagery, where an object (also called segment) is a group of pixels with similar spectral, spatial, and/or texture attributes. Traditional classification methods are pixel-based, meaning that spectral information in each pixel is used to classify imagery.

Recognition: Once the gesture regions have been extracted in the previous phase, they are analyzed to identify specific gestures recognition technic uses the spatio-temporal data or some spatio-temporal features in order to match them with some training data and /or classify them depending on application and system requirement deferent approaches such as statistical modeling, computer region, pattern recognition, and image processing are used in this phase.
